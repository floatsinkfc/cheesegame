Cheese Game

The Cheese Game is a simple arcade-style game developed in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls a mouse and tries to collect pieces of cheese while avoiding obstacles and bombs. The objective is to collect all the cheese pieces without running out of lives.

Features:
- Player controls: The player can move the mouse character up, down, left, and right using the keyboard arrow keys.
- Cheese and obstacles: Cheese pieces are randomly placed on the screen, and the player needs to collect them by colliding with them. However, there are also obstacles and bombs that the player needs to avoid. Colliding with obstacles reduces the player's score and colliding with bombs decreases the player's lives.
- Speed boost: The player can activate a speed boost by pressing the space bar, which increases the mouse's speed temporarily.
- Multiple levels: The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty. The player needs to collect a certain number of cheese pieces to advance to the next level.
- Timer: The game includes a timer to track the player's progress. The elapsed time is displayed on the screen.
